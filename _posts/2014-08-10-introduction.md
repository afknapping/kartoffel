This is not a Book and it is for people who have no time (and teams who don't have money to hire a dedicated UX person). Read over a weekend, use something on Monday.

A weekend read will not make you a dedicated UX person. But hopefully it will give you one or two things to try out. I call that the 'better than' approach. If you can work a little better on Monday than you could on Friday, that is progress. Good thing. Better than is better.

The methods operate on two levels. The first level is about creating product value for your users. The second level is about creating human value for you and your team.

So [Value is where it all starts]({{ site.baseurl }}/2014/08/10/value/).
