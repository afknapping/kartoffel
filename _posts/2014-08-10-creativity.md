title:  "Creativity is not a talent"
---


Those are John Cleese' words from his famous "On creativity" talk. You should watch that talk, but here is my take on this.

You do not need "a creative" in your team. You need creativity in all team members.

Coding is by all means a creative task. But often coders were told what to do in such an ignorant, imperative way, that they stay back from approaching the underlying goal or problem in a creative way.

Okay, wait a second. What exactly is this creativity?

In short it is the difference between playing and "working" in the traditional sense. To be creative you need to allow yourself to get off the path, u-turn, run in circles and get stuck. Creativity means throwing away nine ideas to get to idea number ten, which is finally what everyone was looking for: elegant, simple, maybe-a-little-bit-clever-but-not-too-clever-please. It's a numbers game.

That of course means producing "waste" in the traditional waste. And that's why firms hire experts: they claim to produce value without such waste. By per definitionem that means not being creative and rely on tested solutions.

Don't get me wrong: that can totally be the right thing to do. But if you do not have the resources to hire an expert, creativity is all you have left.

Creativity needs time, space and protection.

Time as in time box actually. If all time was play, it would lose its special magic power. The value comes from being scarce and knowing you have to get back on the rail again.

Space as in a an area away from your every-day-long grunt work desk. Doesn't need to be a room. Ask if you can get an additional standing desk in a corner of the office and offer that others can of course use it too. If the cost of that is a concern, find a new job with sane people.

Protection is most difficult part. Do not expect it. Expect to get harsh criticism. Expect to get *ridiculous* feedback. Don't get defensive. Listen for the useful hints in those rants. It's okay other people do not like it. You didn't *make* it so others should like it, remember? You were *exploring*. You were *not* promising to explore the riches of stolen Inka gold. Getting a thick skin is the surest and the only independent way to protect your creativity.

Company and team culture *can* be of great help here of course â€“ but the scope of this book is what you as an individual can *just do*. And you cannot *just do* culture.
