# Quick and dirty

The goal:

- Find one thing and take one hour on monday to try it out
- The Better-Than Approach™

# Value and Creativity

---

# Value

- product value
- human value
- communication
- collaboration
- value journal

# Value is, wait for it, the only thing of value.

# Creativity

- throwing away nine ideas to get to idea number ten
- it's not "waste", it is *process*
- needs time, space and protection
- get a thick skin
- culture helps. a lot!

- can be digitized
- for internal purposes only
- be critical with usertests
